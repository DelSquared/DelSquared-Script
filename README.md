# DelSquared-Script
DelSquared-Script. A very basic interpreted scripting language written in Rust. This project is recreational.

# Goals For This Language
Mainly I am leaning towards keeping it as minimalistic as possible (syntactically speaking). In the future once everthing is a bit settled in I might use it to natively be very fast at numerical computation but that's just wishfull thinking for now.

# Installation
So far, just clone and `cargo build`. As can be seen from the `.toml` there are no dependencies so far. This may change in the future but I will try to use as few dependencies as possible.

# Documentation
So far the language literally does nothing except from reading the script file and prints some debug output. Will update this space once there's something worthy of mentioning.
